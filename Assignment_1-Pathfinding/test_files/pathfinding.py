'''
This program will use different algorithms to
navigate the map file from the start position
to the end position. 
- The agent is our AI with the goal to find a
path from the start position to the end position
.
- The environment is our map file which contains
 the various destinaions and walls that will be
 navgiated through using a closed list and 
 open/fringe list.

Algorithms:
Breadth first
Lowest cost
Greedy best first
A* with at least two different heuristics.
